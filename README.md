# 🧠 Disaster Tweet Classification

Welcome to this project for the **Kaggle NLP Getting Started Competition**:  
[Link to the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)

## 🗒️ Description

The goal of this project is to classify tweets as **real disaster tweets (1)** or **not disaster tweets (0)**.  
This task is framed as a **binary classification** problem using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

Disaster relief organizations and news agencies want to programmatically monitor Twitter to detect real-time disaster reports. However, not all tweets using disaster-related language refer to actual emergencies — this is where machine learning comes in.
